I don't have time to write a general python script yet. Maybe it will be updated later. 

The most important parts here are data_analysis_and_preprocess.py, Trainer.py, PatchBasedPredictor.py and Evaluator.py. The dataset needs to be in the form of images and labels or in the form of imagesTr+labelsTr, imagesVal+labelsVal, (imagesTs) plus dataset.yaml.

The website of the sample dataset is as follows: [Home - Grand Challenge (grand-challenge.org)](https://segrap2023.grand-challenge.org/)
